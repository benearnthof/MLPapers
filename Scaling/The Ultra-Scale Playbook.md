Rough overview of techniques: 
* Data Parallelism
* Tensor Parallelism
* Pipeline Parallelism
* Context Parallelism
* ZeRO (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054)
* Kernel Fusion

The core problem is that ultra-scale training is extremely expensive, so we want to use the available hardware to its fullest potential, eliminating downtime and minimizing communication overhead. Every dimension of parallelism incurs a debt to training throughput. Sooner or later that debt is paid.

We want to find a delicate balance between memory usage, compute efficiency, and communication overhead during training. If GPUs spend more time offloading to CPU or being forced to idle because of synchronization issues we are wasting potential compute resources. If models don't fit into memory we cannot train at all. 

On large batch training: [[An Empirical Model of Large-Batch Training]]

For LLMs batch size is commonly reported as batch size tokens (bst)
Sweet spot for training LLMs is on th eorder of 4-60 million tokens per batch.

Basically any deep model stores 4 items in GPU HBM: 
* Model weights
* Model gradients
* Activations needed to compute the gradients
* Optimizer state
Some memory is reserved to initialize CUDA kernels, some memory is also used for buffers and intermediate results. Additionally, some memory may be unavailable due to fragmentation.

Activation memory scales linearly in batch size but quadratically in sequence length
	[[Reducing Activation Recomputation in Large Transformer Models]]

Selective Activation Recomputation is they key: 
	Expensive Feedforward computations should be checkpointed
	Attention operations are pretty cheap and can be rematerialized
	For GPT-3 selective recomputation would lead to a 70% activation memory reduction at a 2.7% increase in compute cost

Gradient accumulation linearly decreases the activation memory footprint but also scales the time required to compute gradients for each batch linearly.

## Data Parallelism
(Gradient accumulation across multiple GPUs)

Because we dispatch different micro batches to each respective GPU we cannot just update the copies of the model on each of them separately. We use **all-reduce** to average the gradients from the model instances before the optimizer step.

Naively waiting for all GPUs to sync would lead to downtime. This is why we employ the following optimizations, to overlap communication and computation.

### Overlapping Gradient Synchronization with Backward Pass
The depth of the neural network to be optimized is the main reason this is useful at all. While the gradients of the preceding layers are still being computed, the results for the last layers (the first layers in the backward pass) can already be communicated across devices and the optimization steps for these layers can ideally be completed while the rest of the backward pass is still running. This communication computation overlap decreases idle time and thus increases throughput.

In pytorch this can be done by attaching an all-reduce hook to each parameter: 
```python
def register_backward_hook(self, hook):
    """
    Registers a backward hook for all parameters of the model that 
    require gradients.
    """
    for p in self.module.parameters():
        if p.requires_grad is True:
            p.register_post_accumulate_grad_hook(hook)
```

### Bucketing Gradients
Instead of calling multiple small all-reduce operations for every leaf tensor we instead pack them into buckets before executing an all-reduce operation for the entire bucket at once. 
[[PyTorch Distributed]] pages 4 & 5 are a good reference here.
Parameter-to-Bucket Mapping has considerable impact on DDP speed. Buckets are always created on the same device as the parameters copied into them, this naturally has to take device affinity into consideration as models grow and require multiple GPUs to fit them entirely. DDP launches allreduce in the reverse order of model.parameters(). The key ingredient for performance is finding a balanced bucket size that takes advantage of inter device bandwidth yet still allows communication/computation overlap to increase throughput.

### Interplay with Gradient Accumulation
If we're utilizing gradient accumulation to increase batch size we perform multiple forward and backward passes before updating the parameters. In a na√Øve implementation one might trigger an allreduce after each backward pass during the accumulation, we can prevent this by adding a model.no_sync() decorator that disables gradient sync during the backward passes that don't need reduction. 

## Zero Redundancy Optimizer [[ZeRO]]
Data parallelism introduces significant memory redundancy since, at least for a basic implementation, we keep the full optimizer state and model parameters in each GPU. The three levels of ZeRO will introduce Optimizer State Partitioning, Gradient Partitioning, and Parameter Partitioning.

In vanilla DP, all ranks gather the same gradients after the backward pass and simultaneously perform identical optimizer steps. It seems like a natural idea to offload this with the help of some slight additional communication overhead which, again, we might overlap with computation to further decrease impedance on throughput while drastically cutting down on memory usage.

### ZeRO-1: Partitioning Optimizer States
In ZeRO-1, the optimizer states are partitioned into $N_d$ equal parts, where $N_d$ is the degree of Data-Parallel instances. This means each GPU only keeps track of $\frac{1}{N_d}$ of the total optimizer state and during each optimization operation only $\frac{1}{N_d}$ of the FP32 weights are being updated.
To compute the forward pass, each instance needs access to the full model parameters, this means we require an additional **all-gather** operation after the optimizer step, such that each GPU has the complete set of updated weights at its disposal. 
We can outline the algorithm as follows: 

1. Perform BF16 forward pass on each replica, with different micro-batches across replicas
2. Perform backward pass with full set of gradients on each replica
3. Perform **reduce-scatter** on the gradients 
4. Each replica performs an optimizer step on its local optimizer states to get $\frac{1}{N_d}$ updated FP32 parameters and convert to BF16 parameters
5. Perform **all-gather** on BF16 parameters to send missing slices to each replica.

### ZeRO-2: Adding Gradient Partitioning
In a nutshell, each GPU only keeps the gradients respective to its optimizer state, further reducing allocated memory for each instance. Depending on the implementation this can achieve even better throughput than ZeRO-1 with almost no real additional overhead since we are already performing a reduce-scatter for the gradients and an all-gather over the parameters anyway. 

### ZeRO-3: Adding Parameter Partitioning (FSDP)
As we perform the forward pass and sequentially go through layers we gather the necessary parameters on demand and immediately flush them from memory when they are no longer required. We basically exploit the sequential forward computation to minimize allocated memory even further, at the cost of all-gather operations at runtime. The backward pass also employs this strategy, just in reverse order.
This results in $2 * num_{layers}-1$ additional all-gather operations per training step, each of which incurs a small latency overhead. This can be minimized in practice by *prefetching* the required parameters (or gradients) for the subsequent (or previous) layers respectively. 
Disregarding communication overhead, this could in theory allow us to drive memory usage down indefinitely, as long as we're able to scale up the number of GPUs we're using. In practice though, one starts to run into diminishing returns in throughput at around 64 nodes / 512 GPUs. 

## Tensor Parallelism
This form of parallelism leverages the structure of the matrix operations performed in deep learning themselves. We can split matrix-matrix products into chunks/shards then **broadcast** these shards to individual GPUs, perform operations on them and finally, **all-gather** the results. 

Here we have the choice of either splitting operations by column or by row, the only difference being that row-wise splitting requires a **scatter** operation instead of a **broadcast** operation, with an **all-reduce** operation to calculate the final sum. 

### Tensor Parallelism in a Transformer Block
We split the feedforward layer into a column linear and row linear pipeline that chunks operations appropriately. The Multi-Head Attention operation can also make efficient use of these ideas.

In general, we can split the QKV matrices in a column-parallel fashion, again considering the output projection in a row-linear way. This has a natural interpretation for MHA: The column-parallel splitting can be thought of as splitting the MHA layer across heads, where each GPU in turn computes the attention operation for an individual (or a subset of) head(s). Similar approaches work well for [[MQA Fast Transformer Decoding]] and [[GQA Generalized Multi Query Attention]], where keys and values are shared between queries. 
This is one of the main reasons why Transformers scale so exceptionally well on modern GPU hardware, Multihead Attention can be split along the $num_{heads}$ dimension and makes extremely good use of parallel hardware. Of course one should also note that modern GPU developments (https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/inside-nvidia-blackwell-ultra-the-chip-powering-the-ai-factory-era/) are also very much focused on aligning architecture with the requirements for Attention operations. (Softmax for Blackwell Ultra etc.) 
Specialized architectures like MQA and GQA can also make use of this paradigm easily, but require a couple of tweaks to make sure that the KQ heads stay synchronized across GPUs.

Of course TP is not a Free Lunch, we still incur communication overhead that cannot be overlapped with computation as we have to combine partial results across tensor-parallel ranks before the final LayerNorm can be applied. 
TP reduces activation memory per GPU but still requires us to gather the full activations for LayerNorm, which means we're not getting 100% of the theoretical benefits. 
Communication overhead for TP is minimal, as long as we're keeping everything in one node (typically 8 GPUs) since we can leverage fast NVLink interconnects for inter node communication. But we observe sharp declines in per GPU throughput when scaling up TP to more than one node, as this requires us to utilize slower infiniband or network interfaces. 
## Sequence Parallelism
[[Sequence Parallelism]]
In the previous section we outlined how to efficiently split MHA and Feedforward layers across devices. Tensor Parallelism works well in these cases, since matrix multiplication operations parallelize natively across both row and column dimensions. This does not generalize to operations like LayerNorm, that require access to the full hidden dimension: 
$$
\operatorname{LayerNorm}(x)=\gamma \cdot \frac{x-\mu}{\sqrt{\sigma^2+\epsilon}}+\beta
$$
Where $\mu=\operatorname{mean}(x)$ and $\sigma^2=\operatorname{var}(x)$ are computed across hidden dimensions $h$. While these operations are computationally cheap, they still require significant activation memory. Can we somehow split them along the sequence dimension? Intuition from [[FlashAttention]], in particular the way the Softmax operation is handled, gives us a hint that maybe, through storing and communication of some additional normalization factors, this should be feasible. 

We an imagine grouping operations like so: 
TensorParallel(SelfAttention -> Linear) -> SequenceParallel(Dropout -> LayerNorm) -> TensorParallel(Linear -> GeLU -> Linear) -> ...

Nice blogpost detailing how [[Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers for Near-Infinite Context]] helps address the communication operations for Sequence Parallelism: https://insujang.github.io/2024-01-11/tensor-parallelism-and-sequence-parallelism-detailed-analysis/#sequence-parallelism
Another nice extension that helps distribute compute load evenly:
[[Infinite-LLM - DistAttention]]

For SP, much like for TP, communication cannot be overlapped trivially with computation, leading to drastic decreases in per GPU throughput when scaling above a single node. 
 
If we scale the sequence length the activation memory requirements will still eventually outpace the tensor parallel blocks. If, in turn, the model becomes too big to fit on a single node, we will see a massive performance drop due to the required inter node communication. 
We can address these issues with *Context*- and *Pipeline*-Parallelism.
